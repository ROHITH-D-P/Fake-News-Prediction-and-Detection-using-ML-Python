  FAKE NEWS PREDICTION AND DETECTION

ðŸ”¹I'm happy to share my 1st project " Fake News Prediction and Detection " on Virtual Data Science Intern using Machine Learning Algorithms.

ðŸ”¹Fake news has become a pervasive problem in the digital age, posing significant challenges to the credibility of information disseminated through various media channels. The proliferation of false information can lead to widespread misinformation, influence public opinion, and cause socio-political and economic disturbances. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for detecting fake news, leveraging Machine Learning techniques to analyze and classify news articles as either genuine or fake.

ðŸ”¹The dataset utilized for this project comprises news articles labeled as fake or true. The project workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Preprocessing steps involve cleaning the text data, removing stop words, and normalizing the text. Feature extraction is performed using methods such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert textual data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

ðŸ”¹Multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier are employed to train models on the dataset. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models.
