  FAKE NEWS PREDICTION AND DETECTION

ðŸ”¹I'm happy to share my 1st project " Fake News Prediction and Detection " on Virtual Data Science Intern using Machine Learning Algorithms.

ðŸ”¹Fake news has become a pervasive problem in the digital age, posing significant challenges to the credibility of information disseminated through various media channels. The proliferation of false information can lead to widespread misinformation, influence public opinion, and cause socio-political and economic disturbances. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for detecting fake news, leveraging Machine Learning techniques to analyze and classify news articles as either genuine or fake.

ðŸ”¹The dataset utilized for this project comprises news articles labeled as fake or true. The project workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Preprocessing steps involve cleaning the text data, removing stop words, and normalizing the text. Feature extraction is performed using methods such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert textual data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

ðŸ”¹Multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier are employed to train models on the dataset. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models.

ðŸ”¹The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system in accurately distinguishing between fake and true news articles. The model's predictive performance highlights its potential application in real-world scenarios, such as social media platforms and news aggregators, to combat the spread of misinformation.

ðŸ”¹In conclusion, this project presents a comprehensive approach to fake news detection using machine learning and NLP. The developed system contributes to the ongoing efforts to uphold information integrity and offers a viable solution to mitigate the adverse effects of fake news on society. Future work will explore advanced deep learning techniques and the integration of additional contextual information to further enhance the accuracy and reliability of the detection system.

ðŸ”¹I would like to thank Hellotech Softwares for the guidance.
