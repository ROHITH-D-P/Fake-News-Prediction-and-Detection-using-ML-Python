      "\"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr  There are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it.  In a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : â€œRepublicans, it is time to come homeâ€ https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I  â€” ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016  The Democratic Party couldnâ€™t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryanâ€™s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryanâ€™s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day.  The ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a â€œprincipledâ€ conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trumpâ€™s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan â€“ like many of his colleagues â€“ turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze.  Whatâ€™s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didnâ€™t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up.  If 2016â€™s very ugly election has done any good itâ€™s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events.  Featured image via Twitter\"\n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday defended a Republican tax-cut plan against Democratic charges that it favors the rich, saying it will be â€œone of the great Christmas giftsâ€ for the middle class with just days to go before Congress votes. With a vote on the biggest tax rewrite in three decades set for Tuesday, Republicans were working to ensure party members were holding the line in favor of the legislation against entrenched Democratic opposition. The plan was finalized on Friday after Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Bob Corker pledged their support. Three Republican senators, enough to defeat the measure in a Senate that Trumpâ€™s party controls with a slim 52-48 majority, remained uncommitted: Susan Collins, Jeff Flake and Mike Lee. Passage in Congress would provide Republicans and Trump with their first major victory since he took office in January. â€œItâ€™s going to be one of the great Christmas gifts to middle-income people,â€ Trump told reporters at the White House before he boarded a helicopter for meetings at Camp David. â€œThe Democrats have their sound bite, the standard sound bite before they even know what the bill is all about,â€ he added. The proposed package would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent and cut taxes for wealthy Americans. Under an agreement between the House of Representatives and the Senate, the corporate tax would be 1 percentage point higher than the 20 percent rate earlier proposed, but still far below the current headline rate of 35 percent, a deep tax reduction that corporations have sought for years. Democrats have slammed the plan as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit. For months, Trump has touted the bill as a middle-class tax cut. Studies from independent analysts and non-partisan congressional researchers have projected that corporations and the rich would benefit disproportionately. Trump repeated on Saturday that the tax overhaul would help bring in $4 trillion in foreign profits from U.S. companies. The tax plan proposes new rules for repatriating cash held overseas. â€œThis is going to bring money in. As an example, we think $4 trillion is going to be flowing back into the country,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s money thatâ€™s overseas thatâ€™sÂ stuck there for years and years.â€ \n",
